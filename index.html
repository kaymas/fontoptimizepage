        <h2>Font Loading periods</h2>

        <p>There are basically 2 types of loading periods when Webfonts are involved<br>
        they are : <strong>FOIT</strong> and <strong>FOUT</strong>

        <p><strong class="strong">FOIT</strong> : This is the Invisible text period as I like to put it.
          This is also referred to as the block period where the site has been loaded and the
          elements of the file have been parsed and are ready to be displayed, but
          since the browser doesn't load the font for the text unless its required
          hence in this block period the browser tries to load the font for the
          content that requires it by looking for it in the cache, or the in the local
          file system or the address specified by the developer.
          <br>I like to call it as the Invisible text period because in this period the browser
          doesn't displays any text (not even the text with the fallback font) because
          the browser is still trying to load the webfont.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong class="strong">FOUT</strong> : There was a time when the block period was infinite
          hence the user would just see whitespace until the webfont was loaded. To correct this
          a swap period was added and the length of the block period was defined.
          This period starts when the webfont hasn't been loaded the browser yet and the block period
          has ended. So in this swap period the browser just shows the text in the fallback font that
          has been provided in the stylesheets.<br>I like to call this the Ugly Text period because
          the fallback font isn't exactly the beautiful font that you initally wanted the user to see.
