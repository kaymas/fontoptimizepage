Font loading periods
FOIT - block period (when text isn't displayed because specified font hasn't been downloaded)
FOUT - swap period (when the font hasn't been downloaded but the block period has ended so browser just displays the fallback font)

FOIT - invisible text
FOUT - ugly text (fallback font text)

How to fix

FOIT is way worse than FOUT

TO minimize FOIT
  Don't use Webfonts, just use local fonts (Github doesn't)

  Download fewer things
    woff2 is better than other fonts

    see if the font is available locally first by using statement like
      ex : @font-face
        src: local('Roboto'), url(https://font.woff2) format('woff2')

    don't have to download entire font
      use unicode-range
        ex : unicode-range: U+0-A0

  just download really important things earlier
    use preload
      <link rel="preload" href="https://font.woff2"
        as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin>

  use font face observer js library
    css
      body.fonts-loaded
        font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif
      body
        font-family: sans-serif

    js
      var font = new FontFaceObserver('Roboto')
      font.load().then(function(){
        document.body.classList.add('fonts-loaded');
      });

  control the block swap period
    use font-display
      @font-face
        ...
        font-display: optional

      font-display types
        block (default)
          block period is 3 seconds
          swap or fallback period is infinite till it finds the webfont
        swap
          block period is 0
          swap or fallback period is infinite till it finds the webfont
        fallback
          block period is very short (like 100ms)
            you don't get to download the font but just to load it if its in the cache
          swap or fallback period is 3 seconds
            then after 3 sec if webfont is loaded we switch to it else we don't
        optional
          block period is like fallback (100ms)
          now if webfont is available we switch to it
            but if it's not we go to fallback font(swap period) and not switch to webfont


To minimize FOUT
  try to make the webfont like the fallback font
  so that when the switch takes place its not jarring
  to the user.
    can do this using line height, letter spacing, word spacing, font-size, font-weight
